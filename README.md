# Private Lesson Scheduler

## Project Abstract
_This proposed project is a standalone project aiming to improve my own experience at my part time job as a karate instructor. Many instructors at different schools, myself included, offer private training to students as a way to improve a student's skills and make money on the side. Organizing these private lessons can be tedious and disorganized, especially when you grow upwards of 10 students, all with different schedules, that you need to fit in on one or a few days._
_My proposal is a phone app which would solve every organizational issue that pertains to scheduling and maintaining private lessons._

## Project Relevance
This project will combine many aspects of the course to produce a standalone, professional feeling application which will improve the lives of me and my coworkers/friends across many karate schools. The student's profiles will be objects with many data fields, satisfying the requirements of object oriented design. The app will be user tested by myself and my coworkers, as well as code tested with XCode testing packages. We may need access to a database, but at the very least will be accessing the phone's memory to store user and instructor information over time. There will also be a need for a smooth looking GUI to make people actually want to use the application. 
The design will likely undergo many changes, as I have a lot of pain points when it comes to my current scheduling practices, and as a result have a lot of ideas I would like to implement which are outlined below. 
I hope to learn a lot about the standard progression of building an application, apply version control concepts, and create a usable and functional application. I also hope to apply concepts I am currently learning in User Experience Design class to interview potential users and discover the most important features for them. 

## Conceptual Design
_This app will be designed to bring together all aspects of private training into an organized and easy to use scheduler._ 

Ideal Proposed Features, likely not everything will be implemented: 
- Allows user to schedule lessons on a calendar from a few days up to months in advance.
  - Simple UI with tiles of students to move lessons around a schedule
  - Ability to automate sending out messages to parents to schedule lessons in advance
  - Ability to have pre written lesson invite text formats (i.e. Available this time slot, reply Y or N), listen for confirmation
  - Ability to schedule virtual zoom lessons, including sending reminder to student AND instructor with zoom link attached
  - Ability to lock preferred time slots for regular students, and autofill the rest of the time slots with irregular lessons
- Stores profiles of every student with information including but not limited to:
  - Student's name / profile picture / belt level
  - Parent's name / phone number
  - Preferred day / time for lessons
  - Store any pre bought lesson packs and track them as they are used
  - Training goals, i.e. tournament training, weapons training, sparring, kata/self defense, martial arts tricking (flips and high level kicks), etc
  - A log of each lesson and the student's progress
  - Video reference of skills over time
- Instructor Earnings Tracking
  - Store instructor's lesson rates
  - Calculate earnings each week/month/year
  - Provide graphs to track earnings over time, will help for tax purposes

## Background

## Required Resources
- _NEED an Apple computer to run XCode_
- _Preferably some experience with XCode_
- _Preferably some experience making iPhone apps_
- _Preferably have an iPhone to test the software yourself_


Note: I do not personally have much experience with iPhone app development, this will be a learning process for everyone involved.
